# Obsidian_Notes
This repo was designed to keep track of all work related to the side project which is currently being worked on.</br>

It uses a tool called "Obsidian" which is a free note taking software bundle that uses custom markdown that can be found here:</br>

Offical Docs: https://obsidian.md/ 

## Usage
Download and install the "Obsidian" tool from the offical website, and then select the "Notes" directory as the "Obsidian Vault" location.</br>

This should automatically load all of the markdown files that exist within the repo.</br>
All of the actual Roadmap + Side Project Notes are located within, alongside a "How To Guide" on how to use "Obsidian".</br>

"Obsidian" can also be used to make diagrams via "Mermaid" technology, as well as give the user the abiity to export any of the notes into PDF format.</br>
